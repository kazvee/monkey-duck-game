## Purpose

This project was created by [me](https://github.com/kazvee) for my own amusement (and learning). 👩‍🎓  

This project started off as a Monkey Sort algorithm, which I leveraged to crash my browser a lot! 😃  

Once the fun of that wore off, I wondered what else I could do with the array of emojis and some monkeys... 🤔  

Then I had an idea! 💡  

**So I built it.**  😎

🍌 Emojis are loaded to the screen  
🦆 Add some ducks  
🐒 Add a monkey  
🤹 Ask the monkey to shuffle the emojis  
🏆 Get some of your ducks in a row, and **WIN!** 🥳
